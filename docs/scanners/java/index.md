# Java scanner

The Java scanner carries its own Java compiler runtime and uses `JavacTask`
and `Trees` to read source. A fresh Maven or Gradle checkout needs no
installed JDK, Maven, Gradle, dependency cache, generated sources, or
application build.

One Bun worker thread owns source selection, compiler execution and observation
processing. It sends all selected projects to one JVM, the Java runtime process,
which runs up to four compiler tasks in parallel. Larger source sets start first.
Each task has its own compiler context, roots and language release. Each thread
reuses library-file caches in a file manager for that encoding. Results retain project order. The JVM has
a maximum heap of 2 GiB; source coverage and compiler analysis are unchanged.

From an initialized project:

```sh
groma scanner add @groma/scanner-java
groma scan
```

For local development, a maintainer with JDK 25 builds the package with
`bun plugins/scanners/java/build.ts`, then adds the resulting
`plugins/scanners/java/dist/package` directory to groma.md. The package contains
bundled JavaScript, a precompiled worker JAR and a platform-specific compiler
runtime. The runtime includes its upstream license notices;
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` carries the license texts of the bundled npm
packages, including the MIT-licensed `good-enough-parser`.

## Source inputs

The package declares the default
[include and exclude lists](../index.md#selecting-source-files). It includes
`**/*.java`, `**/pom.xml`, `**/build.gradle`, `**/build.gradle.kts`,
`**/settings.gradle` and `**/settings.gradle.kts`, and excludes `target/`,
`build/` and `.gradle/`. Each exclusion matches a folder of that name anywhere,
including a package folder such as `com/acme/build/` and a declared source root
inside one, such as `build/generated/java`. Of its `.java` files, the scanner
reads only those under each project's main source roots, so test source sets
stay out whatever the lists say.

Each `pom.xml` among the scanner's files identifies a Maven project. Each POM
supplies literal source settings and properties: main source directory, language
release, encoding and artifact name. Defaults are `src/main/java`, the bundled
compiler's language version and UTF-8. POM-only aggregators supply no source
observation.

The scanner does not evaluate Maven, parent POMs, profiles, build plugins,
annotation processors or dependency declarations. It does not load project
JARs or generated outputs. Custom build-added roots are outside the supported
source loader. Unsupported language versions fail the scan; invalid syntax
fails it with every syntax error listed.

Missing external types do not fail the source scan. Their "cannot find symbol"
and "package does not exist" compiler errors form one
`JAVA_MISSING_EXTERNAL_TYPES` info diagnostic with the number of unresolved
references, an example location and the five most frequently missing packages.
In the `groma scan` report, that reference count is part of the message; the
`×N` diagnostic count for this code is 1. javac cannot tell a missing dependency
from any other unresolved name, so the count includes every unresolved name,
such as a typo. Other compiler errors are reported as warnings with their javac
code.

The worker places the selected project root on javac's source path. This lets
named modules with `module-info.java` keep local source bindings without
loading a project build or dependency JARs.

## Gradle projects

The build and settings scripts among the scanner's files, `build.gradle`,
`build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle` and `settings.gradle.kts`, identify Gradle
projects. The scanner reads Groovy and Kotlin scripts with the bundled
`good-enough-parser` library. It never runs Gradle, downloads a Gradle
distribution or plugins, or executes build logic.

Every directory with a build or settings script is a project; a directory with
`pom.xml` is read as a Maven project instead. Literal `include` paths in a
settings script add projects at Gradle's default directories: `:libs:core` is
`libs/core` below the settings script. A literal `rootProject.name` names the
project beside the settings script; other projects use their directory name.

Each project's own build script supplies:

- Main Java source directories. `srcDir` and `srcDirs(...)` add to
  `src/main/java`; `srcDirs = [...]` and `setSrcDirs(...)` replace it. Literal
  values are strings, bracketed lists and `file`, `files`, `listOf` or `setOf`
  calls of strings. Without such a declaration, the project uses
  `src/main/java`.
- The Java language version, from `options.release`, else
  `sourceCompatibility`, else the toolchain `languageVersion`. Literal values
  are numbers, strings, `JavaVersion.VERSION_17` and
  `JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)`. Without one, the bundled compiler's version
  applies.

Gradle sources are read as UTF-8.

A declaration whose value only a Gradle run could resolve, such as a variable,
project property, version catalog entry, string template or computed list,
produces a `JAVA_GRADLE_UNRESOLVED` warning with its script and line. Literal
values of the same declaration and other literal declarations still apply: an
adding declaration keeps `src/main/java`, while a replacing `srcDirs = [...]`
keeps only its literal entries.

Declarations under control flow (`if`, `else`, `when`, `switch`, loops and
`try`), inside a function, for a source set the scanner cannot name, such as
`named(name)` or every source set in `all { }`, or inside `subprojects`,
`rootProject`, `configure(...)` or `project(...)` blocks produce the warning
and are not applied, even with literal values. Settings that assign
`projectDir` or `buildFileName` also produce it; those projects keep Gradle's
default directory and build script name. A declaration inside `allprojects`
applies to the project whose script holds it and produces the warning for the
other projects it configures. A project left without Java sources supplies no
observation, but its warnings still reach the scan report. The scanner does
not read convention plugins, `buildSrc` logic, `gradle.properties` or declared
source encodings.

## Source outline

Components list the declarations of their Java files under the
[shared outline contract](../creating-a-plugin.md#source-outline). The worker
parses each requested file with the bundled compiler's parser, as UTF-8 and
without a classpath or type resolution. A syntax error drops the declarations
that follow it, and a file the parser rejects at its first token, such as one
starting with a byte order mark or holding binary content, outlines nothing.

- Top-level classes, interfaces, enums, records and annotation types are
  types. Package declarations are transparent. Java has no top-level functions:
  a compact source file of top-level methods outlines as one `internal` type
  named after the file, at the line where its first field or method starts,
  holding those methods.
- A type's members are the methods and constructors in its body: static,
  abstract, default and private interface methods, interface and annotation
  element signatures, and compact record constructors. Each overload is listed
  separately, and constructors are named after the type.
- Fields, initializer blocks, nested types, anonymous classes and enum
  constant bodies are not listed.

A line is the line of the declared name. Visibility follows the Java modifier:
`public`, `protected` or `private`. Without one, interface and annotation
members are `public`, a record's compact constructor takes the record's own
access, enum constructors are `private`, and other members and top-level types
are `internal` (package access).

A type is an entry when a Code link names it, such as `Orders`, the form the
scan uses for a file's only type. A member is an entry when a Code link names
it with its type, such as `Orders.place`.

## HTTP endpoints and requests

The scanner reports the [HTTP facts](../evidence.md#http-endpoints-and-requests)
that core joins into derived relationships. It reads annotations and client
calls from source, because project dependencies are never loaded.

Endpoints, from classes only:

- Spring MVC and WebFlux annotated controllers: `@RestController` or
  `@Controller` with `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`,
  `@DeleteMapping`, `@PatchMapping`, or `@RequestMapping` with `method =`,
  under each class-level `@RequestMapping` route. As in Spring, the class-level
  mapping is the class's own, else the first one on its interfaces and then its
  superclass. Only supertypes in the sources are searched, so a type-level
  mapping on an interface from a dependency is missed, an accepted limit. A
  mapping without a method serves every method, and `method =` is read from
  `RequestMethod` constants. A class-level `method` joins each mapping's own,
  as Spring serves both, and a side without a method adds no restriction.
- JAX-RS resources: `@Path` on the class with `@GET`, `@POST`, `@PUT`,
  `@DELETE`, `@PATCH`, `@HEAD` or `@OPTIONS` on a method, under the class path
  and the method's own `@Path`.

Requests:

- declarative clients: a `@FeignClient` interface, with its `path` and `url`
  attributes, and a Spring HTTP interface with `@HttpExchange`, `@GetExchange`,
  `@PostExchange`, `@PutExchange`, `@DeleteExchange` or `@PatchExchange`. Such
  a method has no body, so its request declares the operation itself.
- MicroProfile `@RegisterRestClient` interfaces with JAX-RS `@Path` and HTTP
  method annotations. The remote base remains configured.
- Retrofit interface methods with an imported `retrofit2.http` `@GET`, `@POST`,
  `@PUT`, `@PATCH`, `@DELETE`, `@HEAD` or `@OPTIONS` annotation and a literal
  route. The remote base remains configured.
- `RestTemplate`: `getForObject`, `getForEntity`, `postForObject`,
  `postForEntity`, `postForLocation`, `put`, `delete`, `patchForObject`,
  `headForHeaders`, `optionsForAllow`, and `exchange` or `execute` with an
  `HttpMethod` argument.
- `RestClient` and `WebClient`: the fluent `get()`, `post()`, `put()`,
  `delete()`, `patch()`, `head()`, `options()` or `method(HttpMethod.X)`,
  followed by `uri(...)`. A typed `WebClient.Builder` may supply the client
  through `build()` in that chain.
- `java.net.http.HttpClient`: an `HttpRequest.newBuilder` chain with `uri(...)`
  and `GET()`, `POST(...)`, `PUT(...)`, `DELETE()`, `HEAD()` or
  `method("...")`. A chain that names no method sends GET, as the builder does.
- `OkHttpClient`: a `newCall(request).execute()` or `.enqueue(...)` chain where
  the request is a visible `Request.Builder` URL and method, either inline or
  in a variable that is not reassigned. Constructing a call without sending it
  supplies no request fact. A builder with no stated method sends GET.

An imperative client is recognized by the declared type name of its receiver in
the same file, so a field, a local variable and `new RestTemplate()` all count,
while a client another call returns does not, apart from the typed
`WebClient.Builder.build()` chain. A name the file declares with two
types is dropped, because the receiver is then unknown. Literal routes and URLs,
constants the sources declare and concatenations of them become facts, as does
a field or local that nothing assigns after its declaration, carries no
annotation and has literal text as its initializer. A field Spring injects,
such as one with `@Value`, keeps a configured value. A `{name}` placeholder in
a client URL fills one whole segment.

In a route, a Spring `{name}` or `*` segment is a parameter. A Spring
`{name:regex}` parameter, and a segment mixing text with a placeholder or a
wildcard, such as `v{version}` or `*.json`, is a constrained parameter. A
segment that may span segments or that the fact format cannot state ends the
route with a constrained optional catch-all. That covers a Spring `{*name}` or
`**`, which Spring ranks after every other pattern rather than segment by
segment, a JAX-RS `{name: regex}`, whose expression may match a slash, and a
segment outside URL path characters.

A route the scanner sees but cannot read becomes a blocker: its readable prefix,
then a constrained optional catch-all, for every method unless the methods are
known. The causes are:

- a prefix or route whose constant the sources do not declare, or that holds a
  `${...}` configuration placeholder;
- a class-level prefix holding a wildcard, which Spring joins with each route by
  its own rules;
- a `method` attribute that does not resolve, on the mapping or the class;
- an un-annotated `@Override` method of a controller that, directly or through
  a supertype in the sources, extends or implements a type that does not
  resolve, since that type may declare its mapping. A supertype that resolves,
  such as `java.io.Serializable`, or that is known to declare no mapping, such
  as Spring's `ErrorController`, adds no blocker;
- a JAX-RS sub-resource locator, a `@Path` method without an HTTP method
  annotation.

A blocker never takes a request certainly, and competes with the routes a
request reaches as the
[HTTP request rule](../../relationship-inference.md#http-requests) describes.

Nothing is reported for functional WebFlux, Javalin or Helidon routes, a JAX-RS `@Path`
interface whose implementing class carries no annotation of its own, a mapping
a controller method inherits from an interface method in the sources, an
un-annotated method without `@Override` that implements a method of a type that
does not resolve, an OkHttp call stored and sent in another statement, a builder
chain whose `method(...)` value is not literal, and
filters, interceptors and security matchers such as `/api/**`. A mapping's
`params`, `headers`, `consumes` and `produces` conditions are not part of the
fact: its endpoint serves the path and method whatever they require, as a
client normally calls it.

The [producer checklist](../evidence.md#producer-checklist) for Java:

1. **Which prefixes belong in the path.** Each class-level `@RequestMapping`
   route, found on the class or its supertypes in the sources as Spring does, a
   JAX-RS class `@Path`, a Feign client's `path`, and an HTTP interface's
   `@HttpExchange` value or `url`. A prefix the scanner cannot read and a Spring
   prefix holding a wildcard make the class's routes blockers from that point;
   a client prefix the scanner cannot read reports no requests.
2. **Whether the construct is an endpoint.** Only a controller or resource
   class serves. An interface never does, so `@FeignClient` and `@HttpExchange`
   interfaces report requests even though they carry the same mapping
   annotations. A security matcher, filter or interceptor is not an endpoint.
3. **Dynamic or unknown.** `TALKS + "/" + id` and a declarative `{id}` fill one
   whole segment, so they are dynamic. `TALKS + "/find-" + term` is unknown, as
   is a URL a call computes as a whole.
4. **The local helper.** Not supported. A request is reported where the client
   call is, so `getForObject(buildUrl(suffix), ...)` reports a leading unknown
   segment and `buildUrl` itself reports nothing.
5. **The base.** Every supported client resolves a root-relative URL against
   the base it is configured with, so those requests set `configured`, as
   does a path that follows a field the scanner cannot resolve to text, such
   as an injected base URL or one a constructor assigns. A URL stating a host,
   such as `URI.create("https://api.example.com/api/talks")`, a
   protocol-relative `//api.example.com/api/talks` or a field whose literal
   initializer states one, a URL computed as a whole or taken from a
   parameter, and text continuing a base without a slash, such as
   `base + "talks"` or a relative `"talks"`, report a leading `unknown`
   segment.
6. **Which operation a file-location route names.** Java declares no routes by
   file location, so the scanner names no operation that way.
7. **Which segments are constrained.** `@GetMapping("/talks/{id:\\d+}")`
   reports `talks` and a constrained `id` parameter; `v{version}` and `*.json`
   are constrained parameters. JAX-RS `@Path("{id: \\d+}/latest")` reports a
   constrained optional catch-all named `id` in place of both segments.
8. **Registration order.** Spring MVC, WebFlux and JAX-RS prefer the most
   specific route, so endpoints carry no `order`.

## Compared operations

`groma lint` and scan findings compare Java operations under the
[shared rule](../../architecture-findings.md#compared-operations). The scanner
attaches a source range and body tokens to every method and constructor with a
body, including the methods of a local class.

Lambdas and the methods of an anonymous class body, including an enum constant
body, are anonymous callbacks. Static and instance initializer blocks and field
initializers are initializer code. Neither carries tokens.

Parameters and the variables declared in the body, such as locals, loop, catch
and pattern variables and a local class's fields, become slots in declaration
order, so renaming a local does not change the tokens. A name is a slot only
where the compiler binds it to such a declaration, so a field read after a loop
variable of the same name has gone out of scope stays a field. Field, type and
method names stay as written, including a called name a local shadows and the
operation's own name in a recursive call, as do literals, operators, the
parentheses that group operands, `.member` and `::member` names, array index
operands and control keywords. Declared types are tokens too, so bodies
differing only in `int` and `long`, or `List` and `ArrayList`, are not
identical.

## Evidence

The worker inventories authored main sources, declarations and operations.
Static, private, final, explicit constructor and supported direct receiver calls
can name exact local implementations. Calls affected by attribution errors,
unknown virtual dispatch or missing external code stay unresolved. Method
references do not imply invocation. Spring declarations do not prove dependency
injection or runtime collaborations.

The shared relationship rule selects concrete callback bindings. Ordinary Java
calls do not become architecture arrows. Core owns curated source membership
and relationship selection. Build settings and compiler facts are temporary
evidence, not new OKF records or C4 elements. Markdown readers retain ordinary
Code links and reviewed responsibilities.

Run `bun test test-bun/java-scanner.test.ts` with the maintainer JDK to test
local resolution and uncertainty. `bun test test-bun/java-gradle.test.ts` covers
Gradle project, source directory and version reading without a JDK. The packaged
fresh-checkout test runs with no JDK on PATH. See

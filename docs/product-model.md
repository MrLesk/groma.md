# Product model

groma.md is this repository's architecture, stored as ordinary Markdown and shown
as one C4 world. Solid boxes exist. Ghosts are drafts. A generated picture of
the same repo is already out of date.

The architecture model owns identity. Source code is evidence. groma.md is the
only writer of architecture element and draft files. The project owner
controls the project title, optional concise description, and long overview in
`groma/project.md`, directly or through the web map. The
[architecture Markdown contract](component-markdown.md) defines the strict OKF
v0.2 groma.md profile.

## What you do

People and agents use groma.md. They do not edit architecture element or draft
Markdown by hand. groma.md writes those files so paths, identity, and metadata
stay consistent. The root `groma/project.md` is different: standard `title` and
optional `description` fields are frontmatter, while its normal Markdown body
is the complete project overview. Bare `groma` opens a terminal launcher for
the current repository: Up and Down choose an executable action, Instructions,
or the Advanced commands row. Enter runs an action or opens the selected screen.
The Advanced commands screen contains a read-only table with one concise
description beside each command: `<name>` is required, `[option]` is optional,
and `…` means more options. Up and Down select a command, the table keeps it
visible, and its explanation appears below the table. Tab switches between list
and reading focus. In reading focus, Up and Down scroll the explanation. J and K
scroll it one line in either focus; Page Up and Page Down move it one page. The repository
context, Back row, plugin readiness, and footer remain fixed. Commands stay
read-only. Enter returns from the selected Back row; Backspace always returns
with Advanced commands still selected.
Instructions uses the same logo and repository context,
selects Overview by default, and shows each shipped guide below its guide table.
Up and Down choose a guide in list focus. Tab switches to reading focus, where
arrows scroll content, and back to the guide list. J/K and page keys scroll in
either focus. The footer names the active focus. Backspace or the Back row
returns to the launcher, whose arrows continue to select actions.
Bare `groma instructions` opens this screen on a TTY. Named guides,
non-interactive use, and `--plain` remain plain text. This catalog is for
people. `groma agent-instructions [guide]` is a separate, always-plain catalog
of agent operating rules. Without a guide name it prints an index naming each
task-focused guide, when to read it, and the command that prints it. Every
human guide and the agent index point readers to both catalogs.

`groma init` is the explicit repository-registration action for coding agents.
It reconciles one short managed groma.md block in each distinct root `AGENTS.md`
or `CLAUDE.md` that already exists. If neither exists, it creates only
`AGENTS.md`. Files that resolve to the same target through a symlink are written
once, the symlink and surrounding instructions remain unchanged, and repeated
runs keep one block. No other command performs this reconciliation on its
own; the Web setup form and terminal wizard use this same initialization
operation before opening a map.

1. Open a viewer: see the world. `groma web` scans the repository and starts
   the browser map. On a TTY, `groma view` scans and starts the terminal map.
   Each live process then starts the same watch as `groma scan --watch`, so a
   later source change folds and the map updates. An architecture Markdown
   change reloads the world without scanning. `groma view --plain`, or `groma
   view` when stdout is not a TTY, prints the C4 context level as plain text
   without scanning and does not start the TUI: actors, systems, external
   systems, the relationships between them, and indexes of flows and drafts.
   `groma view <element-id> --plain` goes one level down: the element, its
   direct children, and the relationships crossing its boundary, split into
   incoming and outgoing.
   Every command whose plain output lists items prints one page of 50 items and
   ends with the printed range, the total, and the command for the following
   items; `--max-count <n>` and `--skip <n>` choose the window as in `git log`,
   and `--count` prints only the number of items as in `grep -c`. A complete
   list has no footer, and one `groma view` page spans its sections in order.
   `groma view <element-id|flow-id>` returns the exact complete authored
   Markdown, including metadata, every Code reference, and named sections.
   A flow record includes its ordered Steps table. An exact
   repository-relative source file resolves the element whose `groma.code`
   names it and returns that owner's ID, kind, title, and parent, the file
   connections of map relationships, split into incoming and outgoing, and the
   command that prints the owner's complete record. Rows between files of one
   component are not listed. A draft ID returns its outcome, completion state,
   and member summary. Unknown targets fail with a clear message, and loading
   fails when several elements share a file. These reads do not scan or change
   architecture.
   If the architecture directory, index, or project record is missing, `groma web`
   serves browser setup for the project name and architecture folder. Submitting
   setup initializes the project, scans automatically, and opens the map at the
   same address. Interactive `groma view` offers the terminal initialization
   wizard before scanning. Bare `groma` and interactive `groma instructions`
   use that same Clack offer before opening Welcome. Plain inspection, non-interactive
   `groma`, and `groma --plain` instead fail with one sentence naming
   `groma init`, without a stack trace.
   A successful scan with no components invites TypeScript work in both viewers.
   Until an element has a description or an overview, the architecture is
   still its first scan: the browser map shows a dismissible First scan notice,
   a single `groma scan` ends with the same next step, and
   `groma agent-instructions` opens with a note that tells agents to ask the
   user whether to curate it.
   Existing drafted architecture remains available. Adding supported source
   updates the live map, including when its source directory is new.
   A startup failure reports the actual issue; it is not treated as an empty
   project. The [browser map](viewers/web/index.md) describes its setup and
   creation controls.
2. Publish a snapshot with `groma export <directory>`. The generated static
   site contains the current project profile, architecture map and flows,
   and read-only architecture-owned source inspection. It contains no
   Backlog task data and no pins. It has no editor and never reads the
   repository or a running groma.md server. Everything in the output
   directory is public data.
   Export reads stored architecture without starting a scanner, writes one
   snapshot, and exits. Run it again to publish updated data. Hosting and
   access control belong to the chosen static host, outside groma.md.
3. `groma scan`: scan this repo. Core folds structural scan evidence into Markdown
   and counts architecture findings in the command summary, naming `groma lint`
   to read them. Findings are review
   questions about similar implementations; they are not relationship rows.
   The command prints `ok` and a short summary. It does not print the
   architecture. Scan is the one plain command without paging, because a second
   page would scan again. The scanner alone creates systems, containers, and
   components; nothing writes them by hand.
4. Change the architecture through groma.md's commands; no viewer edits element
   or draft documents.
   - A **new part** is drafted. `groma draft <kind> <name> --parent <id>
     --overview <markdown>` writes a ghost at the path it will keep once
     accepted; the kind is system, container, or component. `--draft
     <draft-id>` files the ghost under a draft record.
   - A **part a draft touches** keeps its solid box and carries the tag:
     `groma edit <element-id> --draft <draft-id>`.
   - An **explanation** of an existing part (notes that describe it without
     changing it) stays on its document. `groma edit <element-id> --overview
     <markdown>` updates that leading body prose. `groma edit <draft-id>
     --overview <markdown>` sets the draft outcome. The optional concise OKF
     field is changed separately with `--description`. `--title` renames a
     part or a draft record while its id and file stay; `--technology` sets or
     clears an element's technology. In the web map the details pane edits
     title, description, overview and technology in place and tags the element
     with a draft; every field posts the input `groma edit` takes.
   - Atomic scan evidence is curated with `groma edit`: combine empty scan
     records, including two systems into one product, move an empty scanned
     component to another container or a container to another system, detach
     files from a component, and group or ungroup sibling components. A moved
     or absorbed record takes every document stored under it to its new path.
     `--id <new-id>` renames an element: its document and the documents under it
     move to the paths of the new ID, children name the new parent, and
     concept-addressed relationship rows and flow steps are repointed. Scans
     match elements through owned files, so a renamed ID survives them. These
     operations validate the whole change before writing.
     `--detach <file...>` removes those files from the component's Code.
     Relationship rows naming a file without an owner stay stored and return to
     the map once a scan owns the file.
   - A group is a name on each sibling component and is addressed as
     `<container-id>/<group-kebab>`: `groma add group <name> <ids...>` names
     it, `groma edit group <address> --title <text>` renames every member,
     `groma remove group <address> [ids...]` takes members out or dissolves
     it. In the web map a multi-selection of components offers Group as and
     Combine into (the person picks the survivor), and a pressed zone opens
     Rename and Dissolve.
   - An interaction is authored with `groma add relation <source-file>
     <target-file> --description <prose> --technology <text>`. Exact source
     files identify code endpoints; actor and external-system declarations
     may use concept IDs. `groma/relationships.md` holds one authored row per
     ordered endpoint pair. `groma edit relation` rewords it; `groma draft
     relation` creates a planned row, and `groma accept relation` accepts it.
     Only draft rows may be removed. The web editor chooses the participating
     files and lets a reader inspect each claim represented by a map connection.
   - **People and outside systems** are declared, never scanned: `groma add
     actor <name> --overview <markdown>` and `groma add external <name>
     [--technology <text>] --overview <markdown>` write them stable at once.
     `groma add draft <name> --overview <markdown>` writes a draft record.
     `groma add component <name>` refuses and names `groma draft`.
   - **Removing** takes the id alone: `groma remove <id>` deletes a person, an
     external, a ghost, or a draft record no ghost belongs to; it refuses and
     names what blocks it while other elements relate to the part, while a
     ghost still contains parts, or while ghosts still carry the draft's tag.
     A scanned component can be removed after its Code list is empty: delete its
     source files and run the owning scanner first. Flows, incoming relationships,
     and children still block removal. Scanned systems and containers stay protected.
     Removing a draft record clears its tag from the stable parts it touched.
   - The project record is the reserved id `project`: `groma edit project
     --title <text> --description <text> --overview <markdown>` merges the
     given fields into `groma/project.md`. The web map's project pencil posts
     the same input.
5. `groma accept <id>`: accept that ghost, only if a scan has matched it.
   groma.md may scan first if needed. No match: the command fails and the
   ghost stays a draft. A scan never accepts a ghost on its own. The file
   stays where it is; only its status changes.

An architect who only wants to see the repo uses 1 and 3. A builder adding
parts from elsewhere asks groma.md to draft them, then uses 1 and 5.
An expert or agent uses the same commands, including from an empty world.

## Identity

An architecture ID is a lowercase kebab-case name in Markdown that stays until
`groma edit <id> --id <new-id>` renames it. groma.md does not put architecture IDs
in application source.

Every element has one file, and every ID is unique in the tree. The file moves
with its element when a move, combine or rename changes the element's parent or
ID. `groma view <id>` resolves exactly one element.

- A drafted element receives its ID when groma.md drafts it. That is the ID it
  keeps when accepted, in the same file.
- A part a draft touches keeps its ID and its file; the tag is the only
  change.
- Core assigns an ID only when a scan finds an unknown file, derived from its
  recognizable file name. It compares new files together, qualifies collisions
  with the existing container and source parent context, and uses a short
  exact-source-path hash only when readable context is exhausted. Titles omit
  the hash. Existing owners keep their IDs on later scans. The
  [Markdown contract](component-markdown.md#files-and-containment) defines the
  allocation rule; source folders do not create new architecture boundaries.
- A scanner never invents an ID for a ghost and never decides that a ghost is
  built.

## The tree

The architecture is one tree under `groma/` (or `.groma/`): `actors/` holds the
people who use the software, `externals/` the systems outside its boundary,
`systems/` the software itself with its containers and components, and
`drafts/` one record per draft. It may be empty. groma.md writes it from scans,
accepted drafts, drafting, and the curation people apply through groma.md. The
scanner alone creates stable systems, containers, and components.

After the first write of a document, later scans may refresh only nested
`groma.code` frontmatter. They do not rewrite explanations, unowned metadata,
or other authored prose.

`groma.technology`, a free-text value with comma-separated parts, is authored
through groma.md. Core reads it and both details panes show it under How it's
built. Only a system may be external: it lives under `externals/` and has no
containers.

## Scanning

`groma scan` runs once and exits. From the user's point of view it succeeds
with `ok` and a short summary of what changed. It does not print elements,
IDs, or a machine-readable architecture. If someone later needs that, it is
a different command, not scan.

`groma scan --watch` is the same scan, left running. It watches supported
TypeScript and C# source and project files. It does not open a viewer. `groma
view` and `groma web` run one scan before opening, then start that watch
in-process.

Each language scanner returns a validated observation of source files, symbols,
source roots, supported execution and interaction facts, and diagnostics. Core
collects the batch before writing Markdown; successful scanners contribute even
when another scanner fails. Scanners do not return C4 elements or architecture
relationships.

Core applies the batch like this:

1. An existing `groma.code` file match keeps its element and authored body. Symbols
   refresh from current evidence, but every curated file remains on that
   element, including files grouped together by a person.
2. Existing boundaries and source ownership guide placement. Source roots,
   directories and imports alone do not create containers.
3. An unknown file becomes a singleton component, unless explicit source-unit
   evidence groups companion files. A matching ghost receives Code and stays a draft.
4. Positive execution-entry evidence lets core create an application container
   and place its unambiguous components. Later scans can complete unidentified
   placement while preserving IDs, source ownership, authored meaning and links.
   Existing container assignments win; shared or uncertain sources remain under
   their known system.
5. Core derives supported interactions from temporary operation and communication
   evidence through current file owners. Raw dependency graphs are not stored.
   A scan supplies no business descriptions. Singleton placement is source
   inventory, not proof of a C4 responsibility.

A scan never turns a ghost into stable architecture.

## Drafts

A draft is an outcome people are drafting toward, not a second complete
system. Its record is `groma/drafts/<draft-id>.md`: the file name is its
immutable kebab-case ID, the frontmatter names it, and the body prose is the
outcome. The elements that belong to it carry `groma.draft: <draft-id>`. A
ghost is an element document with `status: draft`, stored at the path it will
keep. A stable element may carry the tag too: the draft touches it. A draft is
complete when no element carrying its tag is still a draft; its record stays.

A draft describes outcomes and requirements. It does not specify frameworks,
file layouts, or other implementation detail unless a requirement forces it.

Parents resolve in the one tree. A drafted component may name a stable
container as `parent`.

`groma accept <id>` succeeds only when a scan has matched that ID: either
a scan you already ran, or a scan groma.md runs as part of accept. No match:
accept fails and the ghost stays a ghost.

On success, groma.md changes the document's `status` to `stable` in the same
file and keeps its tag. Implementation still happens in source. Accept does
not invent evidence or human verification.

## One world

Core is the only runtime that reads architecture Markdown. It loads every C4
element document under the architecture directory and every draft record under
`drafts/`, merges them into one world, and composes one shared sheet before any
viewer sees it. The sheet gives both maps their surfaces, buildings, groups,
and route paths. Each viewer only projects those fixed cells for its own
screen. It never reads the architecture files or creates another world layout.
The package
requires `groma/index.md` with only the OKF v0.2 declaration and
`groma/project.md` with the explicit groma.md architecture marker.

Core also counts the lines of each element's `groma.code` files; an unreadable
file counts 0. In the web map, every source file belongs to one visible floor
group. Component file counts map project-relative from one to five floors, so
the component with the fewest files has one floor and the component with the
most has five. Each group takes the maximum member LOC and incoming/outgoing stored
interaction counts. Groups are ordered largest-first and lower footprints
expand where needed so no upper floor overhangs them. `heightUnits` range from
one to four, width reflects incoming file interactions, and depth reflects
outgoing file interactions. These counts are computed when loading the model;
raw source-dependency graphs are not persisted. Floors stay
centred on one tower axis, and facade patterns come from normalized file
extensions. The
terminal details pane keeps the aggregate count as `N files · ~M lines`.

A reserved index is not an element. Other typed OKF concepts may coexist in a
marked package, but only the four exact C4 types enter groma.md's architecture
world. A generic OKF package without the groma.md project marker is rejected.

Parents resolve by `id` across the tree. Each source file has one component
owner in the current groma.md profile. Authored code interactions link files;
core projects them through their current owners and preserves them across
rescans and regrouping. Actors and external systems remain explicit concepts.

Core selects automatically derived interactions from temporary operation and
wiring evidence. The first rule covers concretely supplied named callbacks.
Derived and authored rows are stored as ordinary linked Markdown. Current
authored text takes precedence for a matching file pair; a scan never verifies
its meaning or accepts a draft. Parents preserve each statement without
inventing runtime communication. The map bundles claims by directed owner pair
and keeps the underlying file connections available in details.

For two-way derived component interactions, the larger number of distinct
file pairs determines the visible direction. Ties retain both directions;
authored interactions retain their declared direction. Both derived
directions remain in the stored interactions, even when they share one visible route.

Runtime origin follows the standard top-level lifecycle `status` of the
document: `observed` for `stable`, `draft` for `draft`. Observed elements draw
solid, drafts draw dashed. A relationship has its own lifecycle: a row under Relationships is current,
and a row under Draft relationships is planned, independently of its endpoints.
Scans never accept planned links. Explicit acceptance moves the row into the
current table. In the Web map, neutral draft relationships have fixed dashes.
Task highlighting uses solid lines and flow highlighting uses moving dashes
with fixed destination arrowheads, regardless of origin. Clearing the highlight
restores the relationship origin style. Reduced motion keeps flow dashes static.

Git is history. Walking commits shows one file per element changing in place
as drafts are accepted.

## Work

The embedded Backlog work-source plugin reads through the global `backlog` CLI:
the configured statuses and
default status plus one `task list --json` summary containing every configured
task, including terminal history. It reads `task view <id> --json` only for the
task whose full details a developer opens. The last configured status is
terminal. groma.md never reads or watches Backlog storage directly. Static export reads a current task snapshot. Web and terminal
share live updates from the Backlog work source: `task list --json --watch`
provides complete replacement lists, and the plugin notifies its host after
each complete JSON response. Closing the subscription stops the CLI process.
A task touches
every element whose `groma.code` maps one of its modified files, then every element
it references by exact `id`. The terminal map marks tasks in its currently shown
statuses on those elements; default and intermediate statuses start shown. The web map stands one pin per assignee and task
on the element the task touched last; an unassigned mapped task gets one generic
Backlog pin. The Live work island filters pins and chips by the configured
statuses, showing a filter only while that status has a mapped pin. A filter
appears when the first matching pin arrives. The configured terminal status starts
hidden. The configured default status represents future work, starts shown, and uses
draft treatment on the map; every other configured status starts shown. Draft treatment
belongs to the work projection and does not change groma.md architecture records or
Markdown. Without the CLI, the plugin supplies empty work and every architecture flow
remains available.

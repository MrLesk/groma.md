groma.md scans your code into a first [C4](https://c4model.com) architecture map. Your coding agent curates it into the architecture you would explain to a new teammate, and the map stays open while you and your agents work. Save a file and the map updates. Work on a [Backlog.md](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) task and it appears pinned to the components it touches. Everything is plain Markdown in your repository, so architecture changes are reviewed in the same pull request as the code.

Free, MIT-licensed, and local. No account or backend, and groma.md itself calls no AI service: curation uses the coding agent you already work with.

## Get started

Three steps. The scan gives you a first map; your agent turns it into your architecture.

### 1. Install

```sh
npm i -g groma.md backlog.md
```

Backlog.md provides the tasks shown on the map; groma.md works without it. macOS requires Apple Silicon.

### 2. Scan

```sh
cd your-repo
groma web     # browser map on http://localhost:4747
```

On a new project, `groma web` walks you through project setup and scanner selection, then runs the first scan. The scan is deterministic: it turns your source into components and the relationships a scanner can detect. That first map is a starting point you can recognize and navigate, not your architecture yet.

### 3. Curate with your agent

Your coding agent turns the first scan into architecture. It reads the code, names responsibilities, merges records that belong together, and adds the relationships the scanner cannot see. Keep the map open while it works: every change it makes appears on the map. Ask your agent:

```text
Read the current groma.md architecture with `groma agent-instructions` and `groma view --plain`. Compare it with the source code, then annotate the architecture so it reflects the code: combine records that share a responsibility, add missing overviews and relationships, and keep Backlog.md task links current. Use groma.md's CLI for architecture changes, then summarize what you changed.
```

Setup registers groma.md in your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, so your agent knows where to start. Later scans keep what your agent wrote.

## Work with your agent

Agents use the same CLI as people. `groma agent-instructions` prints an index of task-focused agent guides, and every command explains itself through `--help`. Any file resolves to the architecture that owns it, so an agent can start from the code it just changed:

```sh
groma view src/orders.ts    # the owner of this file and its relationships
```

## What you get

- <img src=".github/assets/features/browser-map.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **A browser map you can walk.** Zoom from systems to containers to components. Select anything to read what it does and open the source behind it. [Browser guide](docs/viewers/web/index.md)
- <img src=".github/assets/features/live-updates.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **Live updates.** Saving code refreshes source evidence and detected relationships; new files become new components.
- <img src=".github/assets/features/relationships.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **Relationships and flows.** Describe how components interact, then chain relationships into named flows readers can step through. [Relationships and flows](docs/component-markdown.md)
- <img src=".github/assets/features/drafts.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **Drafts.** Sketch systems, containers, and components before they exist. They appear dashed beside the real ones until a scan matches their code and you accept them. [Draft lifecycle](docs/product-model.md#drafts)
- <img src=".github/assets/features/work.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **See work across the architecture.** Backlog.md tasks pin where people and agents are working; select one to highlight the components it touches and inspect its changes without leaving the map. [Task links](docs/agent-instructions/backlog.md)
- <img src=".github/assets/features/history.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **Explore past architecture with its code.** Open an earlier revision and inspect the source from that same commit, down to functions and methods.
- <img src=".github/assets/features/publish.svg" width="20" height="20" alt=""> **Publish a static site.** `groma export ./site` captures the working tree with architecture, flows, and source. Add `--revision <commit>` for one commit or `--from <base> --revision <head>` for a comparison. Exports contain no task data. Scanning and hosting run separately. [Static publication](docs/viewers/web/index.md#static-publication)

## Plain Markdown, C4, OKF

The architecture lives in a `groma/` folder as an [Open Knowledge Format 0.2](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-knowledge-format/blob/main/SPEC.md) bundle: one Markdown document per element, plus records for relationships, flows, and drafts. C4 gives the structure, OKF keeps it portable, and the documents stay readable without groma.md. [Architecture Markdown contract](docs/component-markdown.md)

More languages arrive as [scanner plugins](docs/scanners/creating-a-plugin.md); add your own with `groma scanner add`. Each scanner's page describes what it reads. See [which relationships groma.md detects](docs/relationship-inference.md#current-inference-rule).

## Experimental

groma.md is an early prototype. Review the first scan before treating it as your architecture, expect rough edges, and check exports before sharing them, since they include source code. Report problems in [Issues](https://github.com/MrLesk/Groma.md/issues).
